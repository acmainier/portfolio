          <p>I've been an IT business project manager, with 10 years of experience in the glass packaging industry and at the French ministry of the Armies.
            FR-EN Customer advisor and LEGO brick specialist for the past 3 years and a half, I'm currently developing my software engineering skills for future career challenges. To be continued...</p>
          <p>In my free time, I like to read fantasy novels, play video games (with or without my son), tend my garden and bake.</p>
